# AEStack
Advanced Engineering Stack 

The intent of the AEStack is to create an engineering package management system that allows the download and installation of an engineering suite. 

Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) - FreeCAD

Model Based Development (MBD) - Open Modelica

Scripting Language - Python

Multi-Body Dynamics (MBD) - Chrono

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) - OpenFOAM

Finite Elemental Analysis (FEA) - Calculix? FreeFEM? + JMAG

Functional Mockup Units (FMU) - UniFMU

Post Processor - Paraview

Also investigate Elmer and FENics. Meshlab?


Office Environment - LibreOffice

Note:

Python environment should include common packages like NumPy, Pandas, Qt, SymPy, SciPy

Perhaps include data visualization tools like PandasGUI

AEStack should build a plugin for Chrono that adds points/joints/etc to FreeCAD.
